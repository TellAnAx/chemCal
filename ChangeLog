2014-04-24  Johannes Ranke <jranke@uni-bremen.de> for chemCal (0.1-33)

	* Bugfix in lod() and loq(): In the case of small absolute x values (e.g. on
	the order of 1e-4 and smaller), the lod or loq calculated using the default
	method could produce inaccurate results as the default tolerance that was
	used in the internal call to optimize is inappropriate in such cases. Now a
	reasonable default is used which can be overriden by the user. Thanks to
	Jérôme Ambroise for reporting the bug.

\title{Assess the linearity of a calibration curve}
\usage{
linearity(x, y, method = NULL, tolerance = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric vector of independent values (usually concentrations).}

\item{y}{numeric vector of dependent values (usually the signal of the
analytical device).}

\item{method}{character string. Supported methods are "slope" and
"curvature".}

\item{tolerance}{numeric value describing the acceptable deviation from the
median of the slopes or the signal-to-concentration ratio. The default
tolerance is 10\%.}
}
\value{
returns a diagnostic plot
}
\description{
A function to create diagnostic plots for the assessment of the linearity of
calibration data based on their point-to-point slope or the curvature.
The underlying methods follow ISO 84 66-1:2021 and DIN 32 402-51:2017
(German Industrial Norm).
}
\details{
The point-to-point slope method is based on the assumption that the slope
between two points should not vary greatly within the linear range.

The curvature method is similar to the point-to-point slope method. Here,
the ratio between the instrument signal and the concentration of the
calibration standard is assumed not to vary greatly within the linear range.

The use of the Mandel test is discouraged due to its limitations in the
identification of non-linear behaviour of calibration courves (Andrade and
Gomes-Carracedo, 2013).

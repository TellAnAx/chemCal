2014-04-24  Johannes Ranke <jranke@uni-bremen.de> for chemCal (0.1-32)

	* Bugfix in lod(): In the case of small absolute x values (e.g. on the order
	of 1e-4 and smaller), the lod calculated using the default method could
	produce inaccurate results as the default tolerance that was used in the
	internal call to optimize is inappropriate in such cases. Now a reasonable
	default is used which can be overriden by the user. Thanks to Jérôme
	Ambroise for reporting the bug.
